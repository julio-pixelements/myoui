# MyoUI

MyoUI is a __basic UI elements__ library and you can use it to make your own user interface.
MyoUI is currently used in the [Myou Editor](https://github.com/myou-engine/myou-engine).

This library was created as a part of Myou Editor, but we moved it to an independent repository
to use it on any other project.

MyoUI is based on React and you don't need to append any extra css file to your project to use it.

The basic UI theme can be easily replaced or extended with your own theme using some tools included in the library.
