## Introduction

MyoUI is a __basic UI elements__ library which you can use it to _make your own user interface_.

MyoUI is currently used in [Myou Editor](https://github.com/myou-engine/myou-editor) and it was initially created as a part of it, but we moved MyoUI to an independent repository to use it on any other project.

MyoUI is based on __React__ and you can use this library requiring it in your project. __You don't need to attach any css file__ to your project to get it working. The default fonts and css animations can be optionally imported to your project only requiring them inside the code.

The theme rules are defined in ```myoui.Theme``` and the style mixins are defined in ```myoui.mixins```. You can use its rules directly in the ```style``` property in your components. __The default theme can be easily modified, replaced or extended__ by your custom theme using some tools included in the library.
